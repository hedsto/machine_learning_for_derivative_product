# machine_learning_for_derivative_product

In this repository, we are going to see how we can evaluate path dependent option like American Option using Machine Learning. It will be separate in 4 parts : 

# 1 - CRR model
# 2 - Algorithm of Longstaff-Schwartz (LS)
# 3 - Comparison LS using Linear Regression (OLS) and using Neural Network (NN)
# 4 - Hedging
